# AndroidResourceWordCount 
Generate word count for an Android string resource file. Example use: 

    python count_words.py ~/workspace/some-android-project/res/values/strings_filter.xml 
    Parsed 122 lines and found 187 words.

Useful when approximating the internationalization cost of an application, since translators often charge per word.
